          Whilst I was working as a Cinema Manager at Odeon cinemas in London I
          helped fetch ideas about how to improve the new app. Since I was
          physically present at the cinema with I had feedback about the app
          first hand from the guests themselves. The major issue with the app
          was the ticket that the guest was struggling to find. Since it was
          only stored in the account section of the app it wasn't always easy to
          find. This was an issue at one particular cinema since the guest had
          to show the ticket multiple times during their visit (i.e. when
          ordering food, entrance to the cinema, entrance to the screen).
          Firstly, I created a nav bar that will always be present at the bottom
          of the device. Then, I suggested the ticket be "always-at-hand" by
          placing it in the middle of the nav bar. I used Adobe XD to prototype
          it.
