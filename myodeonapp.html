        <p>
          Odeon Cinemas is a cinema brand mainly operating in the United
          Kingdom. Whilst I was working as a Cinema Experience Manager at one of
          their cinemas in London, the company was in the middle of launching a
          new app - myOdeon. I helped the team fetch ideas about how to improve
          its functionality. Since I was physically present at the cinema I had
          feedback about the new app from the customers themselves.

      <div class="sub-heading"><h2>Problem</h2></div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The major issue with the app was the location of the cinema ticket
          that the customer was struggling to find since it was only located in
          the account section of the app. On top of that, the customer had to
          have an account created already or create one on spot in order to
          access their digitally purchased ticket. This was inefficient, for
          instance, when the customers were running late for the screening. One
          particular cinema was especially an issue, where the customers had to
          show the ticket multiple times during their visit (i.e. at the
          entrance to the cinema, when ordering food, at the entrance to the
          screen).

        <p>Improve the cinema ticket visibility in the app</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub-heading"><h2>Impact</h2></div>
      <div>
        <p>
          A significant reduction in customers' frustration that effected the
          whole cinema experience and a significant reduction of customers' time
          spent looking for their ticket in the app.

        <p>
          The original app screen did not contain a sticky navbar, only a menu
          that was collapsible on the left-hand side. Therefore, I created a
          navbar that would always be present at the bottom of the user's
          screen. Then, I suggested the ticket be "always-at-hand" by placing it
          in the form of a QR code in the middle of the navbar. This way, the
          customer would have an access to it anytime he or she was asked to
          show their ticket.
