      <p>
        I wanted to create a 404 page for my web project, where I could still
        include links to all the web pages without having to create all the
        pages in one go. This way, the pages I am working on will display the
        404 GIF whilst I will finish off all the web pages. The reason why the
        GIF is larger is because it should cover a whole web page and still have
        a good resolution. I chose to have the GIF animation repeat only once as
        I want it to stop on the last frame, which also displays the text.
