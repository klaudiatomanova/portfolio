        <h6>This is how I created this image</h6>
        <p>
          I wanted to create a more complex image manipulation by merging two
          pictures together, which was a good challenge for me.
        </p>
        <div class="ol">
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, I started with the picture of the window as the background
              and used the pen tool to select the areas of the window that were
              showing the outside world.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then I inserted the picture of the woman diving inside this one
              and used it as a clipping mask to the previous area that I've
              selected with the pen tool
            </li>
            <li>
              I, then, with the pen tool again selected the area of the window
              that was mirroring the outside world and used the picture of the
              woman diving as a clipping mask again. I also reduced the opacity
              of this layer, to create an effect that the window is merely
              mirroring the outside world
            </li>
            <li>
              From the woman diving picture, I've selected the woman and with
              the selection created a new layer, containing just the diving
              woman cut out of the picture
            </li>
            <li>
              I've positioned the diving woman into the window, so it looks like
              as if she was jumping out of the window into the water outside.
            </li>
            <li>
              To make it look more authentic, I've used the soft round brush
              tool 13 to create a splash around her hands, with a colour that
              I've sampled from the water with the eyedropper tool
            </li>

        <h6>This is how I created this image</h6>
        <p>
          I wanted to challenge myself in not only erasing objects and people
          from the photo but also changing the perspective of the image
        </p>
        <div class="ol">
          <ol>
            <li>I duplicated the picture</li>
            <li>
              Then, I used the transform tool to straighten the image, so the
              horizontal line of the pool lays on the X-axes.
            </li>
            <li>
              I used the clone stamp tool to get rid of the shadow of the man
              first, and then the corners of the image that were created after
              I've transformed the picture. The reason why I've duplicated the
              background layer at the beginning, was to keep the same dimensions
              of the image, so I don't have to crop it drastically.
            </li>
            <li>
              With each new layer, I've used the clone stamp tool to delete the
              man, the handrail and correct the waves so they look authentic and
              not repeat themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, I've used the transform tool again only for the part of the
              image with the pool to create a flat effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've used the clone stamp tool to correct the colors of the pool
              and the black stripes in the pool.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the marquee tool, I've selected the top part of the pool and
              filled it with one colour, which I've sampled with the eyedropper
              tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, I've corrected the texture of the top part of the water
              in the pool by using the clone stamp tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              I saved it for web in the highest JPEG quality, not to lose the
              quality, as it was a photograph

          I wanted to create an outline of a coffee splash to serve as a
          background for one of my mockups. The outline of the coffee mug and
          the splash on this picture was perfect for what I was looking for

        <p>
          I wanted to create an original SVG logo that I could reproduce and
          manipulate in all of my mockups. I had an idea in mind, but could not
          find anything on the internet, so I've decided to create one myself
        </p>
        <div class="ol">
          <ol>
            <li>
              I've drawn a coffee cup shape on a paper, I've taken a picture of
              it and opened it in Photoshop
            </li>
            <li>
              Here, I've used the pen curvature tool to select the outline of

            </li>
            <li>
              As I didn't want the picture to be a full coffee mug but just a
              cut out, I've masked an area of the layer that I've selected with
              the pen tool
            </li>
            <li>
              I've saved it as a PNG-8 with 2 colours, which allowed it to be a

        <h6>This is how I created this image</h6>
        <p>
          I have seen images of photos recreated into cartoons and wanted to try
          it myself
        </p>
        <div class="ol">
          <ol>
            <li>I wanted to create a cartoon effect.</li>
            <li>
              I've duplicated the background layer, selected the girl in the
              picture and created a mask from the selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, from the background layer I've created a solid colour layer
              of pink. I've also used the brush tool and created a splash effect
              with just a few mouse click with the brush around the girl.
            </li>
            <li>
              All the layers apart from the background layer I've selected and
              converted to a smart object and duplicated it 2 times, so that I
              get 3 identical layers.
            </li>
            <li>
              First layer: I went to the filter gallery and I've chosen the
              poster edge effect and played around with the thickness, intensity
              and polarization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, I added an unsharp mask from the filter menu, to the image
              to sharpen it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, I went to the filter menu again and chose the oil paint
              filter.
            </li>
            <li>
              I played around with filters, until I've achieved a result that I
              liked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Second layer: I applied the same poster edge effect from the
              filter gallery but with different thickness, intensity and
              polarization. I've also applied the oil pain to this layer and
              changed the blending of this layer to overlay and reduced the
              opacity, so the effects are not too drastic but only subtle.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the third layer, I've chosen the high pass effect and changed
              the layer blend mode to overlay to give it a bit more texture
            </li>
            <li>I've also adjusted levels, vibrance and saturation</li>
